    General information:
There is a P.O.C.L.(Probabilistic Operator Container List) to represent the probabilities of occurences of operators in
the expression. With the help of this list we can decide which operator or operation to come more or less with many details.
To generate a mathematical expression with 3 distinct levels of difficulty there is need to have 3 P.O.C. Lists as well.

    The abstract working principle of the idea:
There is an array named prob which has 23 elements. Each element defines the probability of occurence
of an operator. It can only contain positive integers. And which numbers it should contain is defined after having all
probabilities of pre-defined operators. So that, first, there is need to have probabilities of each and every operator
individually or as groups. Then each probabilty of an individual should be added up to every probabily of an operator which
comes after this one in the list. In this way, the P.O.C.L. is filled in a correct way.

    For example:
Suppose a generated expression should contain + and - 50%, * and / 25%, !/^/% 15%, and all others 10%. Then the probabilities
each group is as follows:

Group1: 0.5     Group2: 0.25    Group3: 0.15    Group4: 0.1
Now, there is need to convert them to the probailities of individual operators:
+: 0.25         *: 0.125        !: 0.05         (: 1/150
-: 0.25         /: 0.125        ^: 0.05         ): 1/150
                                %: 0.05         log: 1/150
                                                sin: 1/150
                                                cos: 1/150
                                                tan: 1/150
                                                arcsin: 1/150
                                                arccos: 1/150
                                                arctan: 1/150
                                                sinh: 1/150
                                                cosh: 1/150
                                                tanh: 1/150
                                                arcsinh: 1/150
                                                arccosh: 1/150
                                                arctanh: 1/150
Now, all the probabilites of individuals have to be converted to positive integers.
And in order to do that we multiply them by their EKOB of denominators(600):
+: 150         *: 75        !: 30         (: 4
-: 150         /: 75        ^: 30         ): 4
                            %: 30         log: 4
                                          sin: 4
                                          cos: 4
                                          tan: 4
                                          arcsin: 4
                                          arccos: 4
                                          arctan: 4
                                          sinh: 4
                                          cosh: 4
                                          tanh: 4
                                          arcsinh: 4
                                          arccosh: 4
                                          arctanh: 4
The last step is the addition:
[Remember the operation list: (, ), log, arcsinh, arccosh, arctanh, arcsin, arccos, arctan, sinh, cosh, tanh, sin, cos, tan, ^,
!, %, *, /, +, -, 1]
P.O.C. List = 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52, 56, 60, 90, 120, 150, 225, 300, 450, 600

    TASK:
    -Create 3 different P.O.C.L. to represent 3 difficulty levels.
    
    Hit: Difficulty levels should be defined with the help normal human senses.
    For example:
    An expression is easy(or has difficulty level of 0) when:
        -contains no parantheses(its 0% is (/))
        -its ~50% is +/-
        -its ~25% is *//
        -its ~15% is ^/!/%
        -its ~10% is others
    An expression is normal(or has difficulty level of 1) when:
        -contains no nested parantheses(but can contain repetitive parantheses)
        -contains no nested operators(but can contain repetitive parantheses)
        -its ~25% is +/-
        -its ~25% is *//
        -its ~25% is ^/!/%
        -its ~25% is others
    And so on.
